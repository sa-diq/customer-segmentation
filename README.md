# Customer-Segmentation

In this project, I utilized machine learning techniques (supervised & unsupervised) to segment customers based on their characteristics and behaviors. By analyzing factors such as gender, age, annual income, and spending score, we aimed to identify distinct customer groups for targeted marketing strategies. The insights gained from this segmentation can help businesses better understand their customer base, tailor their products or services to specific segments, and optimize marketing campaigns for improved customer engagement and retention.<br> <br/>
